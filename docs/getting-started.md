      <td>
        <strong>Explore Resolve AI in our playground.</strong><br>
        Dive into a simulated environment that mirrors the complexity of real production systems: microservices, message queues, caches, databases, and intermittent failures.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Set up Resolve AI for your environment.</strong><br>
        Connect your observability stack, infrastructure, code repositories, and team knowledge to use Resolve AI with your own production systems.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend starting with the **Playground**. It lets you build intuition for Resolve AI's capabilities without any setup. You can switch to your own organizational environment at any time via **Change Orgs → Playground** in the menu.

## Navigating the Homepage

Once you're in, you'll land on the main investigation screen. This is your command center for production intelligence.

### Intuitive Investigations
Ask anything in natural language. No complex query syntax required. Resolve AI correlates logs, traces, metrics, infrastructure, and code to give you answers.

### @ Mentions
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krovvidiv-code/image-storage/main/docs/images/image7.png" width="350" alt="@ mentions">

Type `@` to reference specific services, infrastructure components, or dashboards. Resolve AI pulls deep context from whatever you mention.

### Visual Context
Use the **Image** button to share screenshots of dashboards or error messages. Resolve AI interprets visual data to help accelerate your investigation.

### Smart Suggestions
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krovvidiv-code/image-storage/main/docs/images/image1.png" width="450" alt="Prompt suggestions">

Below the input, you'll find example questions tailored to your environment. These are great starting points if you're exploring a new system.

### Recent Activity

## Core Capabilities

Resolve AI is AI for prod. It works across your code, infrastructure, telemetry, and team knowledge to help engineering teams resolve incidents, optimize costs, and code with prod context.

Engineering teams at companies like Coinbase, ZScaler, Doordash, Salesforce, and Gametime use Resolve to reduce their mean time to resolve incidents and improve engineering productivity.

> [!NOTE]
> ### How it works:
> - **Operates Your Tools:** Connects across your stack to query data or take actions like updating tickets and generating PRs.
> - **Synthesizes Expertise:** Plans investigations like a senior engineer, coordinating multiple agents to build causal timelines.
> - **Evolves with You:** Learns from your runbooks, past incidents, and tribal knowledge, getting smarter with every interaction.

## Use Cases

- **Incident Response:** Resolve AI joins your on-call rotation, investigating issues and surfacing root causes with evidence before you even wake up.
- **Cost Optimization:** Discover infrastructure savings and performance wins through a simple chat interface.
- **Production Context:** Get implementation guidance and insights with the full context of your production system.
